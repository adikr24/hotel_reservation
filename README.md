# hotel_reservation
simulating a hotel reservation software using OOPS concepts

when I started learning about OOPs in python like every data scientist has to one fine day, It was a bit tricky for me since I am not from
a computer science background. After scouring the net for long I came across this link 
https://github.com/karan/Projects-Solutions/blob/master/README.md
It had several projects in OOPs and I tried to understand by going through solutions of various contributors.
Finally I was confident enough to create my own solution to this Airplane/hotel reservation and I tried to be a little creative with it.
I started of by creating a dictionary which contains a year round of dates and then I stored the tickets available for each day, Upon reservation
from the dates specified by the user the seats will be reduced from the dictionary and the plot will show red for booked seats and blue for 
empty seats.
